Allowing WCCC Remote Access with a Service Account

Step 1: Create a service account – ‘qradarsiem’
Step 2: Create a group ‘SIEM Log Readers’
Step 3: Add ‘qradarsiem’ to group ‘SIEM Log Readers’
Step 4: Find SID of Group “SIEM Log Readers”
Step 5: Create a GPO named “SIEM” with the following settings:

Computer Configuration/Policies/Windows Settings/Security Settings/Local Policies/User Rights Assignment/Manage Auditing and security log – Assign “Domain\SIEM Log Readers”

Explanation: Allows anyone in the user group “SIEM Log Readers” to have the token privilege SeAuditPrivilege – Manage Auditing and security log

Computer Configuration/Policies/Windows Settings/Security Settings/Local Policies/Security Options/DCOM: * - Assign “Domain\SIEM Log Readers”

Explanation: Needed when connecting and retrieving remote logs over the network. DCOM: Uses the SDDL (Security Descriptor) to enable access to DCOM objects (Event Viewer)

Computer Configuration/Policies/Windows Settings/Security Settings/Registry
	MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog – Assign “Domain\SIEM Log Readers” Full Access and propagate to all sub keys

Explanation: This registry, by default, only has NTFS permissions for admin users. Editing the registry allows us to specify “Full Access” for user group “SIEM Log Readers”

	MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\WINEVT - Assign “Domain\SIEM Log Readers” Full Access and propagate to all sub keys

Computer Configuration/Registry
Create SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog\System
Value Name: CustomSD
Value Type: REG_SZ
Value Data: O:BAG:SYD:(A;;0xf0005;;;SY)(A;;0x5;;;BA)(A;;0x1;;;S-1-5-32-573)(A;;0x1;;;S-1-5-20)(A;;0x7;;;S-1-5-21-962722181-1340073562-50368464-2728)

Computer Configuration/Regstry
Create SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog\Application
Value Name: CustomSD
Value Type: REG_SZ
Value Data: O:BAG:SYD:(A;;0xf0005;;;SY)(A;;0x5;;;BA)(A;;0x1;;;S-1-5-32-573)(A;;0x1;;;S-1-5-20)(A;;0x7;;;S-1-5-21-962722181-1340073562-50368464-2728)

Explanation: Forces a registry key with “CustomSD” inside of the SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog\System allowing us to specify a custom SDDL to allow access to the event log – the highlighted SID is the SID of the group “SEIM Log Readers” that we obtained in Step 4.
